It does happen to nice people sometimes. Jamie's given him a lovely ride - I hate the way he rides, why does he keep doing that to us?! He gave Witch Hunter a super ride and the horse kind of enjoyed that. When he passes one he gets his momentum. And when they pass him, sometimes he just goes, sod it, I'll go another day. He's a very good horse on his day and I don't care what price he is - Richard Hannon, trainer."

It's difficult to say how high he'll go but he did that quite nicely and if he got the mile, you'd like to think he'd be a Britannia horse - Philip Robinson, racing manager to Saeed Suhail, owner."

We'd had a bit of a look at the race earlier and thought that you would want him a little bit handier round here normally, but there looked to be a good bit of pace on. I think it's really important that Rhoscolyn gets a well-run race and he got one today. David has always been adamant that you get him in a good rhythm and more often than not, that is sitting a little bit further back, because he is a bit too keen and strong in his races. But today, he has relaxed. He jumped better than he did at Beverley when the blindfold came off a bit late, but he's a lot better if the blindfold is off before the last horse goes in. And that was my fault for not reminding the jockey last time out, to be honest. It went to plan today and I couldn't be happier - Chris Dixon, of The Horse Watchers."

Going back up to 7f at a track he's won at before probably all helped but I think Brewing is a horse who is really learning how to drop into gear now, he's been winning but has still looking a bit immature about it but tonight he was direct and true. It was a good performance - Tom Marquand, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."

Then Oisin was at him from halfway. He said he's probably not a five-furlong horse, he probably wants six furlongs. He only really started to give him a feel late on, he's still quite raw. I guess we'll contemplate the National Stakes on the way to the Coventry. It's a stiffer track at Sandown, although very draw dependent again, or maybe we'll be a bit more sensible and try to send him to Ascot two from two, try to find a race he'd be odds-on again for. He's a nice horse going forward, I hope we've got nicer at home - Hugo Palmer, trainer."

I think he'll go for the Premier Novices' Hurdle at Kelso on March 5. I think it was a very good performance today as I think Donald's horse [River Walk] is a nice horse who has done nothing wrong. To not jump, but still quicken like that shows what a big engine he has. He's not looking like he'll fall, but you won't win the bigger races jumping like he is. He won't go to Cheltenham, but could pitch up at Aintree for a novice hurdle if he fares well at Kelso - Alan O'Keefe, assistant trainer."

His first two outings saw him finish in the frame before he won first time out in a handicap this season at Wolverhampton over 1m\u00bdf. He backed that success up with another win at Lingfield the following month off a 2lb higher mark. He is a sweet horse who has done better over the winter than you could possibly hope. The plan is to run him on turf in a 1m2f handicap at Nottingham on April 6. I am sure he can win over that trip again, but he will stay a mile and a half. The handicapper has not given him big rises for each of his runs as they have always been close finishes. With his attitude I cannot see why he will not add more successes to his CV. 06-04-22"

We rode him too far back that day and that is why we rode him handier today.

He's only going to improve as he still has plenty of learning to do and I think he's going to be a better horse next year, when he'll probably want a mile and a quarter.

Both those runs were over 5f and she then went to Hamilton, stepping up to 6f, and put up a good display there, winning again. With racing she's sharpened up a bit and two starts ago at Haydock, when she was third, she ran well in quite a decent race won by Qaseem. I felt that she's speeded up, so I dropped her back to 5f on Sunday at Beverley and she ran a cracker to finish second, beaten only a neck by Mission Command. She was unlucky as she just didn't get the gap when she needed it. I'm not sure where she'll go next, but it'll probably be a stiff 5f or 6f. 28-08-24"

He then went for a Leicester novice where he ran a belter to be denied on the line. I'm seriously considering Royal Ascot for him, either the Windsor Castle or the Norfolk. He's probably more of a 6f horse but I wouldn't be afraid of a stiffer five either. He's got an exceptional mind and is everywhere you need him to be in his work. I think a lot of him. 30-05-24"

He's useful and if he can end up half as good as those two [Baaeed and Hukum] that'll do me.

He came back looking terrific and was an impressive winner at Thirsk on his return in April, landing a 0-95 handicap off 90. That impressed the handicapper as he raised him 7lb to a new high of 97. He has been on ice for the last few weeks and is being trained for a handicap at Royal Ascot, either the Copper Horse [1m6f] or the Duke of Edinburgh [1m4f]. If there were a little ease in the ground on the opening day, I'd lean towards the Copper Horse. Essentially, I'm working back from the Ebor. I'd love to get him in that as a relatively unexposed individual and I think the extra trip won't be an issue as he's from the family of Profound Beauty, who won the Curragh Cup. Realistically we probably need another 3lb on his rating to get in at York and hopefully a big run at the royal meeting will sort that out. With sprinters and stayers, there's not always a massive leap from top handicaps to Group 1s and so he's entered for the Irish St Leger. He's an exciting horse for us and I'm sure there's more to come. 01-06-23"

We started him off over 7f and he didn't show much, but when we tried him over 1m\u00bdf at Wolverhampton he put up a much better show to be a half-length third. It was when we stepped him up to 1m2f last time at Yarmouth that he showed his true colours when comfortably winning by three and a half lengths. It certainly didn't look as if that would be the case at the start as he fluffed it completely, which was a surprise as he had never shown that trait before. I thought the ground might be too quick for him as he has a round action but he was fine and, having given them a fair head start, he ran on very strongly and looked impressive. I think that trip is ideal for him now and despite an 8lb hike in the handicap I think he'll remain very competitive. 30-06-21"

There was very little between him and The Antarctic, and my two-year-olds are improving with every run, so it is good to see him do that. He is a solid, fast horse. We'll have plenty fun with him and there's the Molecomb Stakes at Goodwood that we could look at next- Donnacha O'Brien, trainer."

But he never showed it on the track last year and was one of ours who wasn't quite right. So we chucked him out into the field and when he came back in he was the horse he was last April. He's been great. He won two on the bounce on the all-weather and then nothing really dropped right for him. The worst thing for him was winning over 7f at Southwell because it made us go back to running him over that trip and he's just an out-and-out 6f horse now. When we brought him back to 6f at Haydock last time the race set up beautifully for him and he won. He was drawn next to the best horse who went forward - there were a lot of non-runners because of the ground - and all he had to do was follow the leader, although he won well to be fair. I was probably more surprised at how well he handled a faster surface. He'll probably go back to Haydock in a couple of weeks' time. 28-06-24"

I think we are close enough to warrant a kick at the July Cup, a race in which three-year-olds have done really well in the past. That would be my first thoughts as they cross the line, and as long as he comes back ok from here, he's a horse who deserves to be in the top flight - Clive Cox, trainer."

I think he got a little bit frightened as a juvenile, so we've worked and worked and he had some precious turnout up until Christmas at home. The whole team has worked really hard to be sure that we've kept him right and Jim [Crowley, jockey] seemed to really strike a chord with him in the July Stakes, so I'm just pleased the whole plan has come off. I was a little worried the ground would be too easy for him, but that didn't seem to be a problem. The Commonwealth Cup is absolutely the plan, and the Sandy Lane would be nice. We're looking forward to seeing him on a better surface and Jim has given him a super confidence-building ride. Winning was a super bonus I wasn't entirely sure would happen - Clive Cox, trainer."

His homework suggested he was good enough to win on his debut, but he was a little unlucky there as he went down by a neck having jumped the road at Salisbury. He won next time out at Nottingham, again over 5f, but I thought he was crying out for an extra furlong on that occasion. He could have gone to Royal Ascot but he just wasn't ready. He progressed from his win to his third run in the July Stakes at Newmarket. I was positive about his chances there and he duly obliged, running out an impressive winner. We now have to decide which route to take. I am not one to waste my owner's money on lots of fancy entries, so you can tell how much I thought of him as I had given him an entry in the Gimcrack before he ran at Newmarket. But if he went to the Gimcrack he probably could not go for the Group 1 Prix Morny which is just over a week later, but if he goes to the Richmond at Goodwood on Thursday there would be the ideal time between races. So, at the moment I'm leaning towards Glorious Goodwood, but we will see how the horse is before finalising plans. 02-08-23"

He made a pleasing second start when an impressive winner at Windsor over 6f, where he travelled strongly throughout. We upped him in class to Listed level last month for the Rose Bowl at Newbury where he stepped up with his performance in finishing a good second. On his homework I think 6f is his strip but he is sharp and ideally he would probably be at his best over 5\u00bdf, which leads me to think of the Flying Childers, which we won with Caturra in 2021, who had previously won the Rose Bowl on his way to that Group 2 success. This fellow is definitely going the right way and he runs in the Group 3 Molecomb Stakes at Glorious Goodwood on Wednesday. 02-08-23"

He's been a joy to train, he really has. He likes soft ground because he's out of a Selkirk mare [not because of his thin soles], but over a mile he handles it quick, and we'll take the same route again with him and try to dance every dance again. He'll go to York, he might go to Doncaster for the Park Stakes, I hope he'll go to Longchamp for the Foret, the Sprint at Ascot, Santa Anita.

Kinross is in the Prix Maurice de Gheest and I always felt the Foret would suit him well after his victory in the John Of Gaunt, and we'll work back from there - Ralph Beckett, trainer.  I had loads of horse under me and luckily the gaps came, If I didn't get a gap, I would have been one of the unluckiest dudes. Thankfully one came and Kinross was really gutsy for me. I think he is ground dependent and he has an unbelievable turn of foot on this kind of ground. When it falls it falls perfectly for him and he's really suited by Goodwood, where you're always turning and facing problems. He's got so many gears that he can get out of them - Rossa Ryan, jockey."

There is only one Dewhurst so you have to have a go at it and he has run a great race.

Oisin said seven or eight furlongs. I think actually what looked key there was having pace. He travelled probably the best of them; he enjoyed the pace and the quick ground.  I watched them down at the start and he was probably the one horse not sweating.

He's taken a while to fill out his frame and mature mentally, but he's now doing everything as I hoped he would. He won his first race at Thirsk in June and on his comeback this year he completed a hat-trick at Kempton off a mark of 96. The handicapper has him up to 103 now but we'll be looking at stakes races, so that shouldn't matter too much. He could return to Thirsk next for a 7f conditions race, which would be ideal as we look to step forward. I'm not sure whether he wants an easy 7f on a bend or a stiff 6f. I remember Hey Gaman being very good over 7f and this fellow is rather similar in that respect. After that run we could go to Haydock for a 7f Listed race or to Longchamp for the Group 3 Prix du Palais-Royal, which Hey Gaman won. Racing will really help him improve and it's exciting looking forward with this colt. 19-04-23"

There's a chance he improves again next year and I still think he might be better over seven furlongs, so we've got to explore that avenue as well. He'll have a little bit of a break now as he's done his bit for the summer, but we could travel with him. He's a gelding so we'll go where the best prize-money is that he can win.

The horse was just a runaway when he arrived, he would just bolt. We trained him on a treadmill for the first two months so he never left the yard, before we slowly started to introduce him to the Heath, so there's a lot of work gone into what you're seeing today. He's always had the talent, it's just been a case of letting the horse know it and letting him use it - he's always been fast, that wasn't the problem!

It was a terrific run. He was travelling so well and Maxime Guyon had to go, there was no choice. The agony is that the other horse has come to him, passed him and then he's come back and got him just past the post.

She was taken off her feet there and I didn't think they were going particularly fast. She found plenty. The Chartwell Stakes at Lingfield will come too soon and seven-furlong races are hard to find so we'll just have to sit down and think about it - Henry Candy, trainer."

We thought he was quite high in the handicap and to be honest he hasn't run well round here before. He has run twice here before with no luck but we thought we would take the gamble and give it another go. He has got to be held up and come in the last half a furlong really. The longer you can hold on to him the better. Rhys (Clutterbuck) got the rail and he was just amazing. A lot of horses we have had have been at their best at six, seven or eight. I think he is better over six furlongs when the ground is very soft but it was quick today and I was worried it was a bit too quick. I think we will probably look at something at Royal Ascot now - Philippa Chamings, assistant trainer."

He's going to be gelded and he'll be ready to run early in the new year. He's a well-bred horse with a lot of sprinters in his pedigree.

That is by far his most impressive performance to date. You've got to keep sprinters going when they're in this sort of form because they can soon drop out of it and the Dash is the next target. I've been speaking about it for months, we've been second and third and I'd love to win it. It's a very hot race and it doesn't suit every horse, rolling down a hill, but Fine Wine is so quick and he almost broke the track record at Southwell - Scott Dixon, trainer."

We just have to think very hard about the trip as he didn't stay in last season's Scottish National and this 3m2f is probably more like it, but who's to say as they get older they don't stay a bit better.

He came out of Ireland with a big reputation - I know David Pipe thought a bit of him, but he didn't cut the mustard there - and I'm excited that he's still unexposed. I'm stepping him up in trip to 2m7f on Thursday because it's an ideal race for him. I'm not sure if he's a true three-miler but he might be okay on a sharp track. I think he'll go on any ground. 28-11-24"

You might look at something like the Acomb, and he's very nice. He's a heavy-set, strong lad, so we'll have to be careful and I'd say he'd get seven furlongs no problem.

Unfortunately at Doncaster on his next start, Kieran O'Neill dropped his reins in the last 100 yards and we were just beaten in a photo-finish by Silver Samurai. He might go to Pontefract on Sunday and he'll be a solid handicapper who'll go to the likes of York and be competitive - he was a good fifth there last weekend. 21-06-24"

It was only his first try over six furlongs so I'd like to think there's a lot more to come from him. There's some nice sprints in the summer and he's shown he handles the ground there. We'll see what the handicapper does but he could progress now at that trip. The time was good there and in these big sprint handicaps you need a horse that stays the trip well so that's a big positive. We'll see what comes up but I'm sure by the end of the year there will be bigger and better things on the horizon - Adam Ryan, trainer's son and assistant."

He's a fast horse, started well and the race went smoothly - Ryan Moore, jockey.  Mums Tipple worked very well during the week and it's nice to see him back after his encouraging run at Lingfield. He's a very good horse and it's been a little bit unfair as he gets knocked every time he runs. People want to see a similar performance to what he did at York each time but that was one of the best performances I've seen by any horse - even I was shocked by that - and people haven't given him a break since that. He's got an awful lot of ability so it's nice to see him win, and win very well, at that level. Hopefully he can build on that for the rest of the year and we'll probably go for the Mile on Finals' Day - Richard Hannon, trainer."

He's one of the nicest horses we've had in terms of the way he looks, behaves and moves - he's a little bit different. He does his thing at home and to me he looks like he'll still improve. There are plenty of options for him but he's entered in all the big ones - Richard Hannon, trainer."

He was on the go early in the year, as we brought him back on the all-weather, and his latest start suggested he'd been on the go too long. He's quite a big, rangy horse for a three-year-old and we thought another winter off would do him the world of good, so he's gone on his holidays. He's A1 and we're giving him the chance to really mature and fill into his frame. We think there'll be more improvement in him as a four-year-old and he's one to look forward to next year. 26-09-24"
