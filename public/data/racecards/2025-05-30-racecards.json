His ears were flat back at the start of the race like he didn't want to know, but he's a street fighter like Mike Tyson - if he decides he wants to go ahead of another horse, like he did in the last few furlongs, he's determined not to get beaten. He's struck up a real rapport with Joe - they seem to understand each other. Maybe Joe goes down to his stable in the morning and knows which side of the bed Lexington Knight has got out off before he puts his silks on! We won this race two years ago with Fairmac in the stewards' room, so it's great to win it now comprehensively. The team at Richard's seem to have found the key to him and these sorts of horses are worth their weight in gold - Tim Palin, racing director for Middleham Park."

He's done it nicely and can hopefully win again for the owners. You'd say he'd get further, but I think we'll probably stay at this trip. I wouldn't be opposed to dropping back in trip but that's up the guv'nor. He goes on most ground - Jack Morland, assistant trainer."

He's a strange horse - he'll run a bad race and then he'll win, a typical Mastercraftsman I suppose. He likes the all-weather but I'm keen to go back on the turf. I've explored the avenue of trying to make him stay 2m but I don't think he does. He's come down the handicap a fair amount and is probably dropping to a dangerous mark. The punters will have to tread carefully with their eyes closed, though, to see what horse turns up. 30-04-25"

We probably shouldn't have run him at Cheltenham last time when the rain came. He had a history of breaking blood vessels but I hope we've sorted that out\u0080\u0093 we turn the horses out a lot and he's gained confidence. He's having a break and will be back in the spring.

His work had been encouraging this spring and we started him off over 7f late last month at Yarmouth in what looked a particularly hot maiden, with several of the big yards represented and many trainers liking their charges. He ran a cracker to be third behind New Science, where he was rather green but ran on well. It was the perfect start to his career as he will have learned plenty and mentally handled things well. There are a few 7f maidens around Royal Ascot time later this month and we will pick our spot to make him a winner and take it from there. He runs in the colours of owner Khalifa Dasmal, who is a great man to train for. His patronage is largely thanks to my former guv'nor David Simcock giving him a nod in my direction. David has been a huge help to me in my career and I am very hopeful that I have a potentially nice horse here for Mr Dasmal. 10-06-21"

He's a lot easier for the jockeys to ride over five because the pace of the race helps them, over six he gets in behind and he's climbing. Hopefully he can win again at five - Michael Dods, trainer."

She's gone up 5lb for that to 53, but the way she won you'd like to think she's got a bit more in hand and I see her as a high 50s or low 60s horse. She was ridden last time by Duran Fentiman,  who rides for Tim Easterby. He's an underrated jockey - very strong and capable. 16-05-24"

We very nearly didn't run and I think a lot of Zoffanys like a bit of cut in the ground. We'll probably wait now until we get soft in the going description or get genuinely good ground. He's got a handicap mark, but he could run in a novice with a penalty, or he could run in any race, including, if it got soft, the Acomb. I think he is smart enough and I think he'll be better in a better class of race. He travelled in his race at York and there like nothing would get near him and it's almost like he needs something to take him into the race. I think he's better than he's rated now, but on softer ground he could improve - Hugo Palmer, trainer."

If they're sound they keep giving and they keep lasting; if they're not then they don't do that. I thought he was big enough [odds], but I thought he was that price because of his draw in stall ten. Between myself and Oisin [McSweeney, jockey], we made the plan to go down the middle of the track and he was always in control - Paul Midgley, trainer."

He's a funny little horse; when he's in form, he's in form, and when he isn't in form, he isn't. He's really easy to train and he's been great but he's frustrating at times as he does what he likes. To be fair to him, he's a fast-ground horse but he won on soft at Catterick the time before last. It was soft ground that you could go through and a few of the fancied ones didn't run because the ground changed overnight and we thought we'd got nothing to lose. We'd got an outside stall, where we could get over to the golden highway, and the worst thing we could do was get beat. After about a furlong, he was never going to get beat. We tried to do the same there last time but he just got beat by a progressive one of Bryan Smart's. He's paying his way, whiis great, and hopefully he'll continue to do so. 28-06-24"

Things didn't fall right in her first three runs this year as she was outpaced at York and then at Doncaster the ground was too soft. However, she had been showing me shades of the old Mersea at home in recent weeks and I felt she had a big shout last week at Carlisle. She set off at the front and quickened nicely 2f out to win by three-quarters of a length. She looked like a 5f horse in a 6f race and we got away with it. She's in at Carlisle on Friday over 5f with a penalty and this would be her last chance for a while to run in a 0-75, so if the ground is riding fast I think she'll go there. She's still on a very nice mark. 30-08-23"

She won first time out this year and then the ground was maybe a bit quick for her at Thirsk. Then she won at Pontefract but ran badly again back there the other day, finishing last. She's prone to tying up a bit with her muscles and I think this is a problem we've got to work through. Maybe we'll give her a bit more time between her races so that she doesn't tie up.

I'm still undecided if she prefers 5f.  We thought she was going to be a 1m-plus horse as she was slow, green and didn't know how to gallop at all, but she got a lot quicker at home.  Would we get more improvement holding her up at 1m?  We don't know.  We may try it in future but we don't want to change anything that's working at the moment - Grace Harris, trainer, speaking to Racing TV."

That's why he went to Hamilton for his debut when it was soft. You never know whether horses will like coming down the hill there, and he did get a bit lost, but then he met the rising ground and stayed on well to finish second behind Top Juggler. It was an excellent run for his first race and the winner's n ow rated 79. He's owned by the Denton Hall Racing syndicate - that and our racing club are a good way of getting people into racing without a great outlay and they enjoy it. 28-08-24"

He will have a busy spring and if I can get him there I know his owners, The Turner Family, would love him to run at Cheltenham. That will be the plan and we would be looking at something like the Coral Cup or Martin Pipe Hurdle, but after that I think he could go chasing again. 09-02-23"

It was a brilliant performance and I'll need a vet's opinion on a cut he has on his leg. I hope it's cosmetic and I'm not in a massive rush with him, so I don't think we want to ask him too many big questions too soon. I'd rather give him time and the cut will force that, but I don't think that's a  bad thing. Even if he didn't run until February I wouldn't mind and we'll see how the novice looks, but something like the Pendil could suit - Dan Skelton, trainer."

Twelve months ago he was on a rating of 103, but those four seconds has ensured he is now on a 12lb higher mark. He is one of those horses who always gives his best so life will not get any easier. He has schooled over fences and we think they could bring about a lot of improvement from this big chasing type. Hopefully he makes his chasing debut in the next five or six weeks. He goes over any trip from 2m4f to 3m2f and I feel that once he gets his head in front he could go on a roll. 24-11-21"

Owner Gary Allsopp wants runners at the festivals if possible and it's been one of my aims to win the Foxhunters' at Aintree, so that's the target as he's tailor-made for it. He's got the speed for the 2m5f and he's a very good jumper. We're working backwards from that race and he'll continue to improve because he's full of confidence. 06-12-23"

He was a bit laid-back so he took time to learn and adjust as the race progressed, but he's got a lovely big stride and is a horse who has a future. I'll have to talk to the Middleham Park team about plans and we might just feel our way gradually and have a bigger target towards the end of the year or we could pitch him in somewhere nicer next time, but we'll see how he is. He's an exciting horse, but he's still got a bit to learn and is a bit raw. He'd shown enough at home, plenty to be honest, but he's so laid-back, which was a little concern of mine and that's maybe why he was a longer price than he should have been. I think he's more 6f than 5f and he may get further next year; his stride is quite eyecatching and he seems to do everything effortlessly as you could see with Danny, who didn't have to give him any urgings. He's a Kodiac with a good, strong, powerful action and I think he'd get through easier ground as well; extremes of either ground would not be right - Robert Cowell, trainer."

He wasn't very quickly away and was mid-division but easily made his way through the field and went fourth with a furlong left to run, then once Shane asked him he ran on strongly to take the race. I was delighted with that effort as he justified the faith I've always had in him. This big, raw horse has really thrived physically since then. If all goes well the plan is to start him off in the Ballysax Stakes at Leopardstown over 1m2f next month and I'd say he'll get 1m4f in time. He's an exciting prospect. 17-03-21"

I think he'll be a lovely staying type of horse, it's just a case of keeping him on the right side of the handicapper and bringing him along nice and slowly. He's had a bit of a break but you can expect to see him out before the end of the year and we'd like to find him a race he could win rather than pitching him in too deep. 21-09-23"

We thought at home that a mile and two furlongs is no problem to him, I'd say in time when we step him up into a higher grade of a race and they go a good honest gallop, that might suit him. He was honest today and we'll take the positives out of it.
