She does plenty at home and Kaiya's [Fraser] has given her a great ride. That's his first winner for us and we've been using him for a bit.

Ardad has made a fantastic start to his career and I don't think we will be able to afford any of his progeny this year at the sales. It is a very busy time for us in fact I remember last year we looked 430 horses for the sales and bought around 20, so you don't get these bargains without your research and we have a team of us that spend a lot of hours doing just that. We took him to Bath first time out where he won, not totally surprising as his work had been good. I remember asking the handicapper in the spring what rating he thought I would need to get in the 7f nursery at Glorious Goodwood so we planned on that as his big target. But Lady Luck deserted him in the race as after a furlong he clipped heals and almost fell over, only to regain his composure and finish with a right old flourish to be a fast finishing second. He would have got up in another ten strides. Jason Weaver mentioned it on TV how unlucky we were and what a big thing it would be for a small yard to win at such a prestigious meeting. He was fifth over 7f at Salisbury last week but he should get a mile in time as he's so laidback. 15-09-21"

Maybe the drop back in trip helped him today. His previous form looks like he wants a mile and a half but he's such a strong traveller - perhaps we were barking up the wrong tree with that. He isn't a monkey this horse, he has just had a few issues and maybe he thinks about them a bit. His confidence has been growing the past few months and that will do him the world of good. He had every excuse to down tools but he was very brave - Adrian Wintle, trainer."

He's well handicapped off his mark of 54 as he's a 65-rated horse on his day. He's been second on three of his last four starts and is unlucky not to have won by now, but he'll have his day. Five furlongs is too short for him and going up to 6f on a galloping track will suit him better. He may head to Carlisle on Friday and he'll be winning pretty soon. 30-05-24"

I had a feeling that a step up to three miles or more would really help this horse. I've had my eye on him for a while because they sell enough horses out of Henderson's and he was always just a bit behind the bridle and kept running on strongly. I spoke to a few of the lads in Nicky's yard and they told me a bit about him. Ground is important enough because he definitely wouldn't want it soft. We will keep on going with him until the ground goes. Once these horses are fit they don't need a lot of work. We ride ours every other day and they are turned out in the field all together and we keep them happy - Adam Pogson, joint-trainer."

He has currently dropped to a 1lb lower mark than his most recent win so I expect him to be very competitive on the all-weather and he is certainly in good form at home 23-09-21"

He's the only horse to beat Phil McEntee's Jacquelina on turf this year, who's now rated in the 80s and well thought of. He loves the fast ground and I hope he can continue to progress to pick up a couple more prizes in the Yorkshire area - Rebecca Menzies, trainer."

              "quote": "He has really progressed this winter as having won off 62 in December at Dundalk, he has since added two more wins at the track and is up to a rating of 86 now. The plan is to send him over to Lingfield on Good Friday for either the 1m or 1m2f race. Even though he's now at a career-high mark, I think there could be a little more to come. He's a very talented horse who was highly thought of as a juvenile, but like so many Kingmans he has a mind of his own and has taken a while to get back on track. He was disappointing last time out, but he seems grand at the moment and we'll almost certainly be claiming off him at Lingfield. I'm not entirely sure who'll get the ride but Siobhan Rutledge has won twice on him. 06-04-23"

He went up a fair bit to 80 from an opening mark of 71 - the handicapper actually hiked him 8lb for his last win at Gosforth Park. He relished the stiff 7f there and although he won at Wolverhampton I was not sure the track suited him, and my fears were proved correct last week when he was never happy and although he ran on well at the end it is not his course. We will keep him to stiffer venues in the future and he can win again. 25-05-22"

She has been tipping along all winter but we liked the couple of pieces of work she did. She found plenty and handled the trip well. We will roll the dice a bit with her now. With those fillies, you are as well off to get what you can when you can with them, so we will go for a Listed race somewhere - Noel Meade, trainer."
