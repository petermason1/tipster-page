<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Definite promise during a light Flat career in Britain but still went off 100-1 for a 1m2f soft-ground handicap at Navan (stable debut) and ran accordingly; should enjoy this better ground (provided the rain hasn't arrived) but looks one to watch on hurdle debut.</td>

<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Two turf wins last July and latest was over C&D; needs a close look back in this sphere</td>
<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Two turf wins on fast ground last July and latest was over C&D; down the field on her Kempton reappearance in April but that was a Class 4 and she may have needed the run; now drops back in grade and she needs a close look on this return to turf.</td>

<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Five turf wins, the most recent at Bath (1m, good) last September; now 2lb lower than for that success but he's a frequent slow starter and has been out of sorts in two runs this season; has something to prove and he needs a big turnaround.</td>

<td style="white-space: nowrap;">AW win (5f) in November; 2025 best gives him claims and this intermediate trip should suit</td>
<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Ran well enough at Nottingham in April to think turf was fine and he's feasibly weighted on his best form; hasn't landed a blow the last twice but something bigger could be brewing and this trip should suit.</td>

<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Unplaced in all eight starts but he has shown promise and looked ready to exploit a reduced mark when fourth at Hamilton last month (6f, good to firm; held up and met trouble); Paul Mulrennan booked; of interest in a modest event.</td>
